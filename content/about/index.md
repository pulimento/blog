My name is Javi Pulido, and I'm a Software Engineer born in Huelva and living in Spain (the best corner of Spain ;)

Working as an Android dev since 2011, iOS dev since 2014, currently at Guadaltech.

Besides that, my other programming interests include functional programming and compilers. Some languages Iâ€™ve been dabbling around with (not named Java or Objective-C) are Kotlin, Swift and Perl.

I always try to pay very strong attention to detail, expand my knowledge of computer science, and improve my understanding of software engineering as a whole. I am not afraid to take time to learn a new technology or a new subject, particularly if it helps solve a problem I am working on.

![This is me][1]

This is my first blog, so expect some unexperience here.
