Last two weeks, I've been playing to [**Doom II**](https://www.nintendo.es/Juegos/Programas-descargables-Nintendo-Switch/DOOM-II-Clasico--1610002.html#) in Nintendo Switch. A game that I've completed at least a couple of times, many years ago, probably while using Windows 95 on a 486 or a Pentium 75. Ahh, great times.

I don't consider a hardcore nor a casual gaming myself: I've played a lot of games, but lately, despite having a gaming PC, I've been putting my sight on other hobbies (photography, drone flying). This old game has put my mind again on the past, where the "playability" of the game is at the core of the experience, and not the graphics, nor the sounds (yeah, I know it was ahead of the time, and the BSP-tree thing is mind-boggling). But it's a simple game, as of today standards. You must resolve simple puzzles, you get a scare here and there, and that's it. The story, the plot is simple enough to not distract you, but credible at the same time. A very good balance on my opinion.

I love that games. You don't need to memorize a lot of names, or keyboard mappings. You only sit and play. And running in a platform as Nintendo Switch gives you the bonus of playing anywhere, and power-on-the-console-and-in-15-seconds-you-are-playing thing. I hate that very thing for GTA5, for example. I love that game, but I need a good three or four minutes since I power on my PC, and I'm in game. Well, we can check all the ticks at once, I suppose.

And all of this for 5â‚¬. With support for mods.

Anything else playing it?
